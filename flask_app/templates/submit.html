    <h1>How Accurate are Stock Analyst Recommendations?</h1>
    <p>This application uses the yfinance API to retrieve data on historical prices as well as analyst buy/hold/sell recommendations.
    <br>These analyst recommendations are evaluated based on the distribution of returns after certain recommendation types have been made.</p>

    <p>The API is capable of retrieving stock recommendations for most publicly traded, large-cap companies in the US.
    <br>However, some companies do not have analyst recommendation data available.</p>
    <p>Some great companies to try are Nvidia(NVDA), Tesla(TSLA), AT&T(T), Apple(AAPL)</p>
